# Insurance-claim-Prediction
This project predicts insurance charges using machine learning. Key factors like age, BMI, and smoking status are analyzed using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The best model is selected based on RÂ² Score &amp; RMSE. Future improvements include real-world data integration &amp; deep learning models. ðŸš€
Key Steps in the Analysis
âœ… Data Preprocessing & Exploration

Loaded and cleaned the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations among variables.
âœ… Feature Engineering

Converted categorical variables (e.g., smoker, region) into numerical values using one-hot encoding.
Standardized numerical variables like age, BMI, and children count to improve model efficiency.
âœ… Model Selection & Training

Applied Regression Algorithms such as:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80%-20%) for evaluation.
âœ… Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics

Used metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score to measure accuracy.
Compared models to select the best-performing one for insurance charge predictions.
Key Insights & Findings
ðŸ“Œ Smoking status significantly impacts insurance costs.
ðŸ“Œ Higher BMI and age contribute to increased medical expenses.
ðŸ“Œ Random Forest Regression performed best with the lowest error and highest RÂ² score.
